# Bone-Age-Estimation
Bone age estimation using hand X-Ray images

Well, in this project, we are going to estimate the bone age of people using X-Ray images of the hand.

The dataset used for this project is the Atlas dataset, which is publicly available.

But this dataset requires a pre-processing phase, which is explained below.

This dataset has 1390 photos of the left hand of people from infancy to 18 years old and with 4 different races and 2 types of gender.

Our work is not classification, but regression. The input of our Convolutional Neural Network will be the photo and the output will be the bone age of the person.

We know that the images that enter the network as input must have the same size, but this dataset does not follow this rule. So the first thing we did was to resize all the images to 928Ã—928.

On the other hand, for better training of the network, it is necessary to increase the number of photos. For this reason, we increased the number of photos to 7393 by using the 

The second step was to increase the number of photos to train the network better. For this reason, using the data augmentation technique, we increased the number of photos to 7393. We performed data augmentation manually with the operators such as rotate, flip, increase or decrease brightness according to that photo, color filters. The advantage of doing this process manually was that a number of anomaly photos were detected and removed.

The third step was to create an Excel file as a label for the network.
